## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

This is the first release of the Rust rewrite, replacing the previous Go implementation (v0.1.0-v0.4.1).

#### Core Engine
- **Pattern-based PII detection** with 36+ entity types (emails, SSNs, credit cards, phone numbers, etc.)
- **ML-powered NER** using ONNX Runtime for transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT)
- **Four anonymization strategies**: replace, mask, hash, encrypt
- **Policy-aware processing** with configurable rules and thresholds

#### Crates
- `redact-core` - Core detection and anonymization engine
- `redact-ner` - ONNX-based Named Entity Recognition
- `redact-api` - REST API service (Axum-based)
- `redact-cli` - Command-line tool
- `redact-wasm` - WebAssembly bindings (placeholder)

#### Infrastructure
- Multi-architecture Docker images (AMD64/ARM64)
- Distroless container runtime for minimal attack surface
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with automated releases
- Automated publishing to crates.io and GHCR

### Performance

Benchmarked against Microsoft Presidio:

| Metric | Redact (Rust) | Presidio (Python) | Speedup |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| p50 Latency | 0.20 ms | 6.96 ms | **34x** |
| p99 Latency | 0.96 ms | 22.50 ms | **23x** |
| Throughput | 16,223 req/s | 171 req/s | **95x** |

### Changed

- Complete rewrite from Go to Rust
- License changed from Apache-2.0 to BUSL-1.1

### Migration from Go (v0.4.x)

The Rust version is a complete rewrite with a different API. Key differences:

| Go (v0.4.x) | Rust (v0.5.0) |
|-------------|---------------|
| `redactctl` CLI | `redact` CLI |
| Go library import | Rust crate dependency |
| In-process only | REST API + CLI + WASM |
| Pattern-based only | Pattern + ML-based NER |

See [README.md](README.md) for usage examples.
